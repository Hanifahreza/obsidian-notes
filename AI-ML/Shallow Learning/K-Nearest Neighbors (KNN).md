- It's a supervised algorithm
- When we want to predict the class of a point:
	- Collect $K$ nearest neighbors of the point using a [[Similarity & Distance Measurements#Distance|distance measurement]] as the basis
	- Take the class of the majority in the $K$ nearest neighbors as the point's predicted class
		- If it's regression, take the average of the target features instead
- Usually, the best value for $K$ is:
	- $\sqrt n$ with $n$ is the total number of data points
	- Odd value if the number of classes is even
	- Look for the optimal $K$ with [[Evaluation Methods#Internal Measures (Clusters)|Elbow method]]
