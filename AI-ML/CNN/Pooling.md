- Convolution with input with huge dimension can be slow
## Max Pooling
- We can reduce the number of the dimension by making a kernel that extracts the max value of a window
- Max pooling with $2$ x $2$ size and stride $2$ would look like this

- Beside reducing the size, it also enhances the feature by making them more prominent

## Average Pooling
- Max Pooling but with average instead of max
