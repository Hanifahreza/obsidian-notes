- Faster R-CNN is an extension of [[Fast R-CNN]]
## Key Concepts
### Region Proposal Network (RPN)
- Faster R-CNN ditches [[R-CNN#^25152a|selective search algorithm]] and replace it with **RPN** that's to **generate RoIs**
- RPN is directly integrated with the network with **learnable parameters** which 
- It's connected to the same shared [[Convolution Operation|convolutional]] layers as the object detection network allows for **end-to-end training**
### Anchor Boxes
![[rpn.png]]
- The RPN predicts bounding box proposals by using a set of predefined **anchor boxes** (sliding window) with various scales and aspect ratios
- The anchors are assigned with labels based on 2 factors:
	- The anchors with **highest Intersection-over-union** overlap with a ground truth box
	- The anchors with Intersection-Over-Union Overlap higher than $0.7$
### RoI Pooling
- Region proposals generated by the RPN are processed using RoI pooling to transform them into fixed-size feature maps for object classification and bounding box regression
## Innovations
![[faster r-cnn performance.png]]
- Faster R-CNN introduced the Region Proposal Network (RPN), which significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of object detection.
- It unified the region proposal and object detection processes within a single network, allowing for end-to-end training.
## Limitations
- While Faster R-CNN is more efficient than the original R-CNN, it may still be relatively slow for real-time applications, especially on resource-constrained devices
- Training Faster R-CNN models can be computationally intensive, particularly due to the RPN.
