- Divide a data into $K$ partitions
- Repeat until all partitions got a chance to be train and test dataset
	- Use $x$ partitions for training a model and $y$ partitions to test the model
- Aggregate the results to know the overall performance of the model
- Can be used to compare different models or [[Hyperparameter Tuning]]
