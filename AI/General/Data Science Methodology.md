## What Data Scientists do?
- With DA = Data Analytics,
	- **Descriptive** DA: Describe things based on data
	- **Diagnostic** DA: Explain about a problem based on data
	- **Predictive** DA: Predict future with data
	- **Prescriptive** DA: Recommend an action based on data

## Methodology

- **Business Understanding**
	- What problem are you trying to solve and by what approach (DA’s) will you solve it?  
- **Data Understanding**
	- Collect relevant data and understand it using statistics, visualization, etc.    
- **Data Preparation**
	- Integrate data from multiple sources and clean them up.
	- This process takes the longest time.  
- **Modeling**
	- Use the output from previous step to develop a model based on the selected approach from step 1. 
	- You may need to run multiple experiments to ensure the model’s right. e.g. deciding which parameter to maximize based on previous insight  
- **Evaluation**
	- Evaluate whether the model accurately solves our problem or not. 
	- Use data visualizations for the experiments’ data set.  
- **Deployment**
	- Deploy the model to the environment. 
	- Still need constant reevaluations based on the changing environment.
