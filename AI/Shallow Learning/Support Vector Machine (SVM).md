- We want to separate samples into 2 classes
- We can do this by drawing a 1D line or 2D, 3D, etc hyperplane to separate both classes
- However this is not always possible as demonstrated by the picture below
  ![[svm_use_case.png]]
  - To separate them, we use **kernel trick** in which we bring the samples to a higher dimension with a **kernel**
  - The usually used kernels are:
	  - Linear kernel: $K(x_i, x_j) = x_i^T x_j$
	  - Polynomial kernel: $K(x, y) = (\gamma \langle x, y \rangle + r)^d$
		  - $\gamma$ is the coefficient of the kernel
		  - $d$ is the value of the desired higher dimension
	  - RBF kernel: 
		  - $K(x, y) = \exp\left(-\frac{\|x - y\|^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$
