![[bell-shape curve.png]]
- It's a distribution of probability with a bell-shaped curve
- It can also take different shapes (but still a bell-shaped curve)
![[normal distribution variation.png]]
- The distribution's shape is **parameterized** (defined) by mean $\mu$ and [[EDA Techniques#^516c1d|Standard Deviation]] $\sigma$ (STD)
- Characteristics:
	- It's always centered on the mean value 
	- It's always drawn such that 95% of the data fall between +/- $2 * STD$ around the mean
	- The width of the curve depends on STD
		- The lower the STD, the taller and narrower the bell
- It's the most found distribution irl
