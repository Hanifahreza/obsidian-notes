## Statement 
- As the sample size $n$ increases, 
	- The sampling distribution of the sample mean $\bar{x}$ approaches a [[Normal Distribution]]
	- Regardless of the shape of the population distribution
## Key Assumptions 
  - The random variables in the sample must be independent
  - The random variables must have the same probability distribution with a finite mean $\mu$ and a finite variance $\sigma^2$
  - The sample size must be sufficiently large
	  - Generally, a sample size of $n \geq 30$ is often considered sufficient for the CLT to apply
## Implications
  - It allows for the use of the normal distribution to make inferences about the population mean.
  - It justifies the use of statistical techniques based on the normal distribution, such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.
  - It applies to a wide range of real-world scenarios
## Applications
- The CLT is applied in various fields, such as:
	- Quality control 
	- Survey sampling
	- Hypothesis testing to draw conclusions about population parameters from sample data
