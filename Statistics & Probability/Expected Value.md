- The expected value that represents the long-term average or the center of a probability distribution
- The formula is:
	- For discrete events $$\mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{1}^n x_i \cdot P(X = x_i)$$
	- For continuous events $$\mathbb{E}(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f(x) \, dx$$
- Expected value provides a measure of the "central tendency" of a random variable
- Used for 
	- Decision-making 
	- Risk assessment 
	- Statistical analysis
